Public = Boleh diguna oleh semua class and package di dalam program

Protected = 1. Boleh diguna untuk class yg sama dan package yg sama sahaja
            2. Kalau nak guna, kena extends subslass, dan guna getter and setter method

Private =  1. Boleh diguna oleh class yg sama sahaja.
           2. Kalau nak guna, kena pakai getter and setter method.


Here's an analogy to understand the difference:

Public: Like a public park, anyone can enter and use the facilities.
Protected: Like a family recipe, only family members (subclasses) and close neighbors (classes in the same package) can access it.
Private: Like your bedroom, only you (the class) have access.


Getter -->> Accesscor
Setter -->> Mutator
